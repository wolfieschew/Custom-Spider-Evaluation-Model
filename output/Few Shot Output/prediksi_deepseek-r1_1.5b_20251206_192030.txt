This SQL query selects the StuID from the Student table where the student does not have a cat pet. It uses a subquery to check if the student has a 'Cat' type pet and excludes those students who do.	pets_1
This query selects the StuID from the Student table where the corresponding student has a PetType that is not 'cat'. It uses a JOIN between Student and Has_Pet tables based on StuID, and filters out any pets with type 'cat'.	pets_1
This query selects the first name and last name from the Student table where the student has pets. The inner subquery checks if the pet type is a dog or not a cat, ensuring only students with dogs are included.	pets_1

The SQL query selects the employee name from the "employees" table, joins it with the "evaluation" table on the Employee_ID field. It then groups by each employee's name and counts how many times they appear in the evaluation table. The HAVING clause filters for employees who have more than zero evaluations.	employee_hire_evaluation
